:numbered:


Introduction
------------

Free. Open Source. Powerful. _Taiga_ is a project management platform for startups
and agile developers & designers who want a simple, beautiful tool that makes work
truly enjoyable.


Project Maturity
----------------

Because _Taiga_ is still a young project we consider it is currently in beta state.


API
---
_Taiga_ has a complete REST API (the one used by the web app), check the full API
documentation link:api.html[here].


How it works
------------

_Taiga_ is made up of two components: link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-front[taiga-front]
and link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back[taiga-back]

- *taiga-front* has the front related code built with *angularjs* and *coffescript*.
  It can runs on any static file server like nginx.
- *taiga-back* has the backend related code consisting of an api, built using *django*
  and *python3*.

_Taiga_ has some other modules, but they are optional and documented in other sections.


Requirements
------------

This is a list of major _Taiga_ dependencies:

Runtime:

- Python 3.4
- PostgreSQL >= 9.3
- RabbitMQ (optional if you dont want async notifications)

Compile time:

- GCC & Development Headers
- Ruby 2.1 (only for compile sass)
- NodeJS 0.10 (with npm, gulp and bower for download dependencies and compile coffeescript)

This section details everything you need to know to get _Taiga_ up and running
on both development and production environments.

How to contribute

Examples of contributions include:

- Code patches
- link:#contrib-plugins[Code contrib plugins]

- Bug reports
- Patch reviews

Before starting to develope a big feature (intending to be included on the _Taiga_ code base), it is
strongly recommended that you reach out to us on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].

Reporting bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please consider these general points:

- Check that someone hasn't already filed the bug or feature request by searching our running custom
  queries in the ticket tracker.
- Check the right repository to use for report an issue: bugs related to UI should go to *taiga-front*,
  if something is broken on the backend, an issue should be opened on *taiga-back* repository.
- First ask on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] first if you're not sure if
  what you're seeing is a bug.
- Don't use the github issues system to ask support questions. Use the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] for that.
- Don’t use the github issues for lengthy discussions, because they're likely to get lost. If a particular
  ticket is controversial, please move the discussion to the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].
